# Community-resilience knowledge graph ontology

Here is a modular ontology-style list of entities and relationships you can use as a starting point for a community-resilience knowledge graph focused on disasters.

You can treat the top-level headings as main classes, and the bullets as subclasses / attributes / relation targets.
