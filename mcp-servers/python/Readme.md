# What this server will do

A minimal FastAPI‑style MCP server can expose tools like:

- list_endpoints — inspect your FastAPI routes
- lanalyze_file — read a backend file and return its contents
- generate_model — create a Pydantic model from a JSON sample
- explain_error — help debug Python tracebacks

You can add more later, but this gives you a powerful baseline.
